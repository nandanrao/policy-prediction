abstract = {Causal evidence on microcredit impacts informs theory, practice, and debates about its effectiveness as a development tool. The six randomized evaluations in this volume use a variety of sampling, data collection, experimental design, and econometric strategies to identify causal effects of expanded access to microcredit on borrowers and/or communities. These methods are deployed across an impressive range of locations-six countries on four continents, urban and rural areas-borrower characteristics, loan characteristics, and lender characteristics. Summarizing and interpreting results across studies, we note a consistent pattern of modestly positive, but not transformative, effects. We also discuss directions for future research.},

abstract = {Billions of government dollars, and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs, are dedicated to helping the world's poor. But much of the work they do is based on assumptions that are untested generalizations at best, flat out harmful misperceptions at worst. Banerjee and Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials in development economics. Work based on these principles, supervised by the Poverty Action Lab at MIT, is being carried out in dozens of countries. Their work transforms certain presumptions: that microfinance is a cure-all, that schooling equals learning, that poverty at the level of 99 cents a day is just a more extreme version of the experience any of us have when our income falls uncomfortably low. Throughout, the authors emphasize that life for the poor is simply not like life for everyone else: it is a much more perilous adventure, denied many of the cushions and advantages that are routinely provided to the more affluent”—Provided by publisher.},

abstract = {We report results from a randomized evaluation of a microcredit program introduced in rural areas of Morocco in 2006. Thirteen percent of the households in treatment villages took a loan, and none in control villages did. Among households identified as more likely to borrow, microcredit access led to a significant rise in investment in assets used for self-employment activities, and an increase in profit, but also to a reduction in income from casual labor. Overall there was no gain in income or consumption. We find suggestive evidence that these results are mainly driven by effects on borrowers, rather than by externalities.

We find a positive impact of access to group loans on female entrepreneurship and household food consumption but not on total working hours or income in the household. A simultaneously introduced individual-liability microcredit program delivers no significant poverty impacts. Additional results on informal transfers to families and friends suggest that joint liability may deter borrowers from using loans for noninvestment purposes with stronger impacts as a result. We find no difference in repayment rates between both types of microcredit.},

abstract = {We use a clustered randomized trial, and over 16,000 household surveys, to estimate impacts at the community level from a group lending expansion at 110 percent APR by the largest microlender in Mexico. We find no evidence of transformative impacts on 37 outcomes (although some estimates have large confidence intervals), measured at a mean of 27 months post-expansion, across 6 domains: microen-trepreneurship, income, labor supply, expenditures, social status, and subjective well-being. We also examine distributional impacts using quantile regressions, given theory and evidence regarding negative impacts from borrowing at high interest rates, but do not find strong evidence for heterogeneity. (JEL C83, D14, G21, I31, J23, O12, O16) T he initial promise of microcredit, including such accolades as the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, has given way to intense debate about if and when it is actually an effective development tool. Expanded access to credit may improve the welfare of its recipients by lowering transaction costs and mitigating information asymmetries. Yet theories and empirical evidence from behavioral economics raise concerns about overborrowing at available rates, and microcredit debt traps have drawn much media and political attention in India, Bolivia, the United States, Mexico, and elsewhere. The possibility of positive or negative spillovers from borrowers to nonborrowers adds to the possibility of large net impacts in either direction.},

Durable goods expenditure increased, while “temptation goods” expenditure declined. We found no significant changes in health, education, or women's empowerment.

abstract = {We use data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in 2003–2006 in rural Amhara and Oromiya (Ethiopia) to study the impacts of increasing access to microfinance on a number of socioeconomic outcomes, including income from agriculture, animal husbandry, nonfarm self-employment, labor supply, schooling and indicators of women's empowerment. We document that despite sub-stantial increases in borrowing in areas assigned to treatment the null of no impact cannot be rejected for a large majority of outcomes. B eginning in the 1970s, with the birth of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, microcredit has played a prominent role among development initiatives. Many proponents claim that microfinance has had enormously positive effects among borrowers. However, the rigorous evaluation of such claims of success has been complicated by the endogeneity of program placement and client selection, both common obstacles in program evaluations. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) typi-cally choose to locate in areas predicted to be profitable, and/or where large impacts are expected. In addition, individuals who seek out loans in areas served by MFIs and that are willing and able to form joint-liability borrowing groups (a model often preferred by MFIs) are likely different from others who do not along a number of observable and unobservable factors. Until recently, the results of most evaluations could not be interpreted as conclusively causal because of the lack of an appropriate control group (see Brau and Woller 2004 and Armend{\'{a}}riz de Aghion and Morduch 2005 for comprehensive early surveys). In this context, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide an ideal research design to evaluate the impact of microcredit. In this paper we present the results of one of the few existing RCTs that evaluate the impact of introducing access to microloans in poor communities in a devel-oping country after the early contribution of Banerjee et al. (2014). We study a large-scale clustered RCT conducted in rural Amhara and Oromiya (Ethiopia) between 2003 and 2006. The main purpose of the RCT was to evaluate whether the},

abstract = {This paper reports on the first randomized evaluation of the impact of introducing the standard microcredit group-based lending product in a new market. In 2005, half of 104 slums in Hyderabad, India were randomly selected for opening of a branch of a particular microfinance institution (Spandana) while the remainder were not, although other MFIs were free to enter those slums. Fifteen to 18 months after Spandana began lending in treated areas, households were 8.8 percentage points more likely to have a microcredit loan. They were no more likely to start any new business, although they were more likely to start several at once, and they invested more in their existing businesses. There was no effect on average monthly expenditure per capita.   Expenditure on durable goods increased in treated areas, while expenditures on “temptation  goods” declined. Three to four years after the initial  expansion (after many of the control slums had started getting credit from Spandana and other MFIs ), the probability  of borrowing from an MFI  in treatment and comparison slums was the same, but on average households in treatment slums had been borrowing for longer and in larger amounts. Consumption was still no different in treatment areas, and the average business was still no more profitable, although we find an increase in profits at the top end. We found no changes in any of the development outcomes that are often believed to be affected by microfinance, including health, education, and women's empowerment. The results of this study are largely consistent with those of four other evaluations of similar programs in different contexts.},
