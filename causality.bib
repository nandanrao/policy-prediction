abstract = {We address the problem of causal discov-ery in the two-variable case given a sample from their joint distribution. The proposed method is based on a known assumption that, if X â†’ Y (X causes Y), the marginal distri-bution of the cause, P (X), contains no in-formation about the conditional distribution P (Y |X). Consequently, estimating P (Y |X) from P (X) should not be possible. However, estimating P (X|Y) based on P (Y) may be possible. This paper employs this asymmetry to pro-pose CURE, a causal discovery method which decides upon the causal direction by com-paring the accuracy of the estimations of P (Y |X) and P (X|Y). To this end, we pro-pose a method for estimating a conditional from samples of the corresponding marginal, which we call unsupervised inverse GP re-gression. We evaluate CURE on synthetic and real data. On the latter, our method outperforms existing causal inference meth-ods.},

abstract = {In this completely revised and expanded second edition of Counterfactuals and Causal Inference, the essential features of the counterfactual approach to observational data analysis are presented with examples from the social, demographic, and health sciences. Alternative estimation techniques are first introduced using both the potential outcome model and causal graphs; after which conditioning techniques, such as matching and regression, are presented from a potential outcomes perspective. For research scenarios in which important determinants of causal exposure are unobserved, alternative techniques, such as instrumental variable estimators, longitudinal methods, and estimation via causal mechanisms, are then presented. The importance of causal effect heterogeneity is stressed throughout the book, and the need for deep causal explanation via mechanisms is discussed.

Causal models can be viewed as a special class of graphical models that represent not only the distribution of the observed system but also the distributions under external interventions. They hence enable predictions under hypothetical interventions, which is important for decision making. The challenging task of learning causal models from data always relies on some underlying assumptions.

In particular, we address the problem of data fusionâ€”piecing together multiple datasets collected under heterogeneous conditions (i.e., different populations, regimes, and sampling methods) to obtain valid answers to queries of interest. The availability of multiple heterogeneous datasets presents new opportunities to big data analysts, because the knowledge that can be acquired from combined data would not be possible from any individual source alone. However, the biases that emerge in heterogeneous environments require new analytical tools. Some of these biases, including confounding, sampling selection, and cross-population biases, have been addressed in isolation, largely in restricted parametric models. We here present a general, nonparametric framework for handling these biases and, ultimately, a theoretical solution to the problem of data fusion in causal inference tasks.},

abstract = {The statistics profession is at a unique point in history. The need for valid statistical tools is greater than ever; data sets are massive, often measuring hundreds of thousands of measurements for a single subject. The field is ready to move towards clear objective benchmarks under which tools can be evaluated. Targeted learning allows (1) the full generalization and utilization of cross-validation as an estimator selection tool so that the subjective choices made by humans are now made by the machine, and (2) targeting the fitting of the probability distribution of the data toward the target parameter representing the scientific question of interest. This book is aimed at both statisticians and applied researchers interested in causal inference and general effect estimation for observational and experimental data. Part I is an accessible introduction to super learning and the targeted maximum likelihood estimator, including related concepts necessary to understand and apply these methods. Parts II-IX handle complex data structures and topics applied researchers will immediately recognize from their own research, including time-to-event outcomes, direct and indirect effects, positivity violations, case-control studies, censored data, longitudinal data, and genomic studies."Targeted Learning, by Mark J. van der Laan and Sherri Rose, fills a much needed gap in statistical and causal inference. It protects us from wasting computational, analytical, and data resources on irrelevant aspects of a problem and teaches us how to focus on what is relevant answering questions that researchers truly care about."-Judea Pearl, Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"In summary, this book should be on the shelf of every investigator who conducts observational research and randomized controlled trials. The concepts and methodology are foundational for causal inference and at the same time stay true to what the data at hand can say about the questions that motivate their collection."-Ira B.

Specifically , we construct objective priors for model selection based on the Fractional Bayes Factor, leading to a closed form expression for the marginal likelihood of an EG. Next we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy to explore the space of EGs using sparsity constraints, and illustrate the performance of our method on simulation studies, as well as on a real dataset. Our method provides a coherent quantification of inferential uncertainty, requires minimal prior specification , and shows to be competitive in learning the structure of the data-generating EG when compared to alternative state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Unfortunately, in complex problems (e.g., split-plot designs), it is not always easy to set up an appropriate ANOVA. We propose a hierarchical analysis that automatically gives the correct ANOVA comparisons even in complex scenarios. The inferences for all means and variances are performed under a model with a separate batch of effects for each row of the ANOVA table. We connect to classical ANOVA by working with finite-sample variance components: fixed and random effects models are characterized by inferences about existing levels of a factor and new levels, respectively. We also introduce a new graphical display showing inferences about the standard deviations of each batch of effects. We illustrate with two examples from our applied data analysis, first illustrating the usefulness of our hierarchical computations and displays, and second showing how the ideas of ANOVA are helpful in understanding a previously fit hierarchical model. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2005.},

@article{Engle1983,
abstract = {The effects of firm pension plan provisions on the retirement decisions of older employees are analyzed. The empirical results are based on data from a large firm, with a typical defined benefit pension plan. The "option value" of continued work is the central feature of the analysis. Estimation relies on a retirement decision rule that is close in spirit to the dynamic programming rule but is considerably less complex than a compre- hensive implementation of that rule, thus greatly facilitating the numerical analysis},

@article{Cox2007,
abstract = {Statistical aspects of causality are reviewed in simple form and the impact of recent work discussed. Three distinct notions of causality are set out and implications for densities and for linear dependencies explained. The importance of appreciating the possibility of effect modifiers is stressed, be they intermediate variables, background variables or unobserved confounders. In many contexts the issue of unobserved confounders is salient. The difficulties of interpretation when there are joint effects are discussed and possible modifications of analysis explained. The dangers of uncritical conditioning and marginalization over intermediate response variables are set out and some of the problems of generalizing conclusions to populations and individuals explained. In general terms the importance of search for possibly causal variables is stressed but the need for caution is emphasized. /// On fait une revue critique de la causalit{\'{e}} statistique.
