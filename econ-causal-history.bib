@article{Heckman2015,
abstract = {Haavelmo's seminal 1943 and 1944 papers are the first rigorous treatment of causality. In them, he distinguished the definition of causal parameters from their identification. He showed that causal parameters are defined using hypothetical models that assign variation to some of the inputs determining outcomes while holding all other inputs fixed. He thus formalized and made operational Marshall's (1890) ceteris paribus analysis. We embed Haavelmo's framework into the recursive framework of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) commonly used in the literature of causality (Pearl, 2000) and Bayesian nets (Lauritzen, 1996). We compare the analysis of causality based on a methodology inspired by Haavelmo's ideas with other approaches used in the causal literature of DAGs. We discuss the limitations of methods that solely use the information expressed in DAGs for the identification of economic models. We extend our framework to consider models for simultaneous causality, a central contribution of Haavelmo.},

@article{Haavelmo1943,
abstract = {Measurement of parameters occurring in theoretical equation systems is one of the most important problems of econometrics. If our equations were exact in the observable economic variables involved, this problem would not be one of statistics, but a purely mathematical one of solving a certain system of" observational" equations, having the parameters in question as unknowns. This might itself present complicated and interesting problems, such as the problem of whether or not there is a one-to-one correspondence between each},

The empirical results are based on data from a large firm, with a typical defined benefit pension plan. The "option value" of continued work is the central feature of the analysis. Estimation relies on a retirement decision rule that is close in spirit to the dynamic programming rule but is considerably less complex than a compre- hensive implementation of that rule, thus greatly facilitating the numerical analysis},
