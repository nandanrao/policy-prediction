In particular, we address the problem of data fusion—piecing together multiple datasets collected under heterogeneous conditions (i.e., different populations, regimes, and sampling methods) to obtain valid answers to queries of interest. The availability of multiple heterogeneous datasets presents new opportunities to big data analysts, because the knowledge that can be acquired from combined data would not be possible from any individual source alone. However, the biases that emerge in heterogeneous environments require new analytical tools. Some of these biases, including confounding, sampling selection, and cross-population biases, have been addressed in isolation, largely in restricted parametric models. We here present a general, nonparametric framework for handling these biases and, ultimately, a theoretical solution to the problem of data fusion in causal inference tasks.},

This commit-ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob-lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

Specifically , we construct objective priors for model selection based on the Fractional Bayes Factor, leading to a closed form expression for the marginal likelihood of an EG. Next we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy to explore the space of EGs using sparsity constraints, and illustrate the performance of our method on simulation studies, as well as on a real dataset. Our method provides a coherent quantification of inferential uncertainty, requires minimal prior specification , and shows to be competitive in learning the structure of the data-generating EG when compared to alternative state-of-the-art algorithms.},

While it has previously been shown that the dependence structure of the noise can provide hints to determine which of the two variables is the cause, we presently show that even in the deterministic (noise-free) case, there are asymmetries that can be exploited for causal inference. Our method is based on the idea that if the function and the probability density of the cause are chosen independently, then the distribution of the effect will, in a certain sense, depend on the function. We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, showing that it also works in the low noise regime, and link it to information geometry. We report strong empirical results on various real-world data sets from different domains.},

Unfortunately, in complex problems (e.g., split-plot designs), it is not always easy to set up an appropriate ANOVA. We propose a hierarchical analysis that automatically gives the correct ANOVA comparisons even in complex scenarios. The inferences for all means and variances are performed under a model with a separate batch of effects for each row of the ANOVA table. We connect to classical ANOVA by working with finite-sample variance components: fixed and random effects models are characterized by inferences about existing levels of a factor and new levels, respectively. We also introduce a new graphical display showing inferences about the standard deviations of each batch of effects. We illustrate with two examples from our applied data analysis, first illustrating the usefulness of our hierarchical computations and displays, and second showing how the ideas of ANOVA are helpful in understanding a previously fit hierarchical model. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2005.},

The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested. 1.},

abstract = {When training a deep neural network for image classification, one can broadly distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the classification. We can divide latent features into (i) "core" or "conditionally invariant" features {\$}X{\^{}}\backslashtext{\{}core{\}}{\$} whose distribution {\$}X{\^{}}\backslashtext{\{}core{\}}\backslashvert Y{\$}, conditional on the class {\$}Y{\$}, does not change substantially across domains and (ii) "style" features {\$}X{\^{}}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}style{\}}{\}}{\$} whose distribution {\$}X{\^{}}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}style{\}}{\}} \backslashvert Y{\$} can change substantially across domains. Examples for style features include position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex ones like hair color, image quality or posture for images of persons. Our goal is to minimize a loss that is robust under changes in the distribution of these style features. In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself is not observed and hence a latent variable. We do assume that we can sometimes observe a typically discrete identifier or "{\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}ID{\}}{\$} variable". In some applications we know, for example, that two images show the same person, and {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}ID{\}}{\$} then refers to the identity of the person. The proposed method requires only a small fraction of images to have {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}ID{\}}{\$} information. We group observations if they share the same class and identifier {\$}(Y,\backslashmathrm{\{}ID{\}})=(y,\backslashmathrm{\{}id{\}}){\$} and penalize the conditional variance of the prediction or the loss if we condition on {\$}(Y,\backslashmathrm{\{}ID{\}}){\$}. Using a causal framework, this conditional variance regularization (CoRe) is shown to protect asymptotically against shifts in the distribution of the style variables. Empirically, we show that the CoRe penalty improves predictive accuracy substantially in settings where domain changes occur in terms of image quality, brightness and color while we also look at more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture.},

To this end, Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) [10] has been proposed which learns a causal model exploiting the invariance of causal relations in different environments. When considering linear models, the implementation of ICP is relatively straightforward; the nonlinear case, however, is more challenging due to the difficulty of performing nonparametric tests for conditional independence. In this work, we present one method for nonlinear Invariant Causal Prediction. As an example, we consider fertility rate modeling which is central to world population projections. We explore predicting the effect of hypothetical interventions using the accepted models from nonlinear ICP.},

abstract = {Inferring the causal structure that links n observables is usually based upon detecting statistical dependences and choosing simple graphs that make the joint measure Markovian. Here we argue why causal inference is also possible when the sample size is one. We develop a theory how to generate causal graphs explaining similarities between single objects. To this end, we replace the notion of conditional stochastic independence in the causal Markov condition with the vanishing of conditional algorithmic mutual information and describe the corresponding causal inference rules. We explain why a consistent reformulation of causal inference in terms of algorithmic complexity implies a new inference principle that takes into account also the complexity of conditional probability densities, making it possible to select among Markov equivalent causal graphs. This insight provides a theoretical foundation of a heuristic principle proposed in earlier work. We also sketch some ideas on how to replace Kolmogorov complexity with decidable complexity criteria. This can be seen as an algorithmic analog of replacing the empirically undecidable question of statistical independence with practical independence tests that are based on implicit or explicit assumptions on the underlying distribution. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The statistics profession is at a unique point in history. The need for valid statistical tools is greater than ever; data sets are massive, often measuring hundreds of thousands of measurements for a single subject. The field is ready to move towards clear objective benchmarks under which tools can be evaluated. Targeted learning allows (1) the full generalization and utilization of cross-validation as an estimator selection tool so that the subjective choices made by humans are now made by the machine, and (2) targeting the fitting of the probability distribution of the data toward the target parameter representing the scientific question of interest. This book is aimed at both statisticians and applied researchers interested in causal inference and general effect estimation for observational and experimental data. Part I is an accessible introduction to super learning and the targeted maximum likelihood estimator, including related concepts necessary to understand and apply these methods. Parts II-IX handle complex data structures and topics applied researchers will immediately recognize from their own research, including time-to-event outcomes, direct and indirect effects, positivity violations, case-control studies, censored data, longitudinal data, and genomic studies."Targeted Learning, by Mark J. van der Laan and Sherri Rose, fills a much needed gap in statistical and causal inference. It protects us from wasting computational, analytical, and data resources on irrelevant aspects of a problem and teaches us how to focus on what is relevant answering questions that researchers truly care about."-Judea Pearl, Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"In summary, this book should be on the shelf of every investigator who conducts observational research and randomized controlled trials. The concepts and methodology are foundational for causal inference and at the same time stay true to what the data at hand can say about the questions that motivate their collection."-Ira B.

abstract = {To draw scientifically meaningful conclusions and build reliable models of quantitative phenomena, cause and effect must be taken into consideration (either implicitly or explicitly). This is particularly challenging when the measurements are not from controlled experimental (interventional) settings, since cause and effect can be obscured by spurious, indirect influences. Modern predictive techniques from machine learning are capable of capturing high-dimensional, nonlinear relationships between variables while relying on few parametric or probabilistic model assumptions. However, since these techniques are associational, applied to observational data they are prone to picking up spurious influences from non-experimental (observational) data, making their predictions unreliable. Techniques from causal inference, such as probabilistic causal diagrams and do-calculus, provide powerful (nonparametric) tools for drawing causal inferences from such observational data. However, these techniques are often incompatible with modern, nonparametric machine learning algorithms since they typically require explicit probabilistic models. Here, we develop causal bootstrapping for augmenting classical nonparametric bootstrap resampling with information on the causal relationship between variables. This makes it possible to resample observational data such that, if it is possible to identify an interventional relationship from that data, new data representing that relationship can be simulated from the original observational data. In this way, we can use modern machine learning algorithms unaltered to make statistically powerful, yet causally-robust, predictions. We develop several causal bootstrapping algorithms for drawing interventional inferences from observational data, for classification and regression problems, and demonstrate, using synthetic and real-world examples, the value of this approach.},

abstract = {An important goal common to domain adaptation and causal inference is to make accurate predictions when the distributions for the source (or training) domain(s) and target (or test) domain(s) differ. In many cases, these different distributions can be modeled as different contexts of a single underlying system, in which each distribution corresponds to a different perturbation of the system, or in causal terms, an intervention. We focus on a class of such causal domain adaptation problems, where data for one or more source domains are given, and the task is to predict the distribution of a certain target variable from measurements of other variables in one or more target domains. We propose an approach for solving these problems that exploits causal inference and does not rely on prior knowledge of the causal graph, the type of interventions or the intervention targets. We demonstrate our approach by evaluating a possible implementation on simulated and real world data.},

Distributional robustness is here understood as optimizing the predictive accuracy for a whole class of distributions instead of just a single target distribution. The class of distributions considered is often a ball around the empirical distribution, using a Wasserstein or Kullback-Leibler distance. Causal inference can be seen as a special case of distributional robustness, where the class of distributions is generated by a causal model. Different choices for these classes are discussed, which correspond to different assumptions about the type of interventions and presence or absence of latent confounding variables.},

abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

Inspired by causal methodology, we relax the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant over all tasks. We show how this assumption can be motivated from ideas in the field of causality. We focus on the problem of Domain Generalization, in which no examples from the test task are observed. We prove that in an adversarial setting using this subset for prediction is optimal in Domain Generalization; we further provide examples, in which the tasks are sufficiently diverse and the estimator therefore outperforms pooling the data, even on average. If examples from the test task are available, we also provide a method to transfer knowledge from the training tasks and exploit all available features for prediction. However, we provide no guarantees for this method. We introduce a practical method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset and provide corresponding code.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This has implications for popular scenarios such as covariate shift, concept drift, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning. We argue that causal knowledge may facilitate some approaches for a given problem, and rule out others. In particular, we formulate a hypothesis for when semi-supervised learning can help, and corroborate it with empirical results.},

abstract = {We address the problem of causal discov-ery in the two-variable case given a sample from their joint distribution. The proposed method is based on a known assumption that, if X → Y (X causes Y), the marginal distri-bution of the cause, P (X), contains no in-formation about the conditional distribution P (Y |X). Consequently, estimating P (Y |X) from P (X) should not be possible. However, estimating P (X|Y) based on P (Y) may be possible. This paper employs this asymmetry to pro-pose CURE, a causal discovery method which decides upon the causal direction by com-paring the accuracy of the estimations of P (Y |X) and P (X|Y). To this end, we pro-pose a method for estimating a conditional from samples of the corresponding marginal, which we call unsupervised inverse GP re-gression. We evaluate CURE on synthetic and real data. On the latter, our method outperforms existing causal inference meth-ods.},

We describe an asymptotically correct algorithm whose complexity for fixed graph connectivity increases polynomially in the number of vertices, and may in practice recover sparse graphs with several hundred variables. From sample data with n = 20,000, an implementation of the algorithm on a DECStation 3100 recovers the edges in a linear version of the ALARM network with 37 vertices and 46 edges. Fewer than 8{\%} of the undirected edges are incorrectly identified in the output. Without prior ordering information, the program also determines the direction of edges for the ALARM graph with an error rate of 14{\%}. Processing time is less than 10 seconds.

abstract = {NOVELTY - The tibial implant component has a tibial tray (26) adjacent the augmentation location and a depending structure extending longitudinally from the tibial tray. The tibial tray has a proximal surface and an opposite distal surface. An abutment is made on the depending structure, which extends transversely along the depending structure adjacent the augmentation location. The securing element is coupled with the tibial augment for selective rotation about a longitudinal axis of rotation located adjacent the abutment when the tibial augment is placed at the augmentation location and juxtaposed with the tibial tray. USE - For facilitating securement of a selected augment to an implant component, such as the securement of a selected tibial augment to a tibial implant component of a prosthetic knee implant. ADVANTAGE - Enables a surgeon quickly and effectively to attach a selected augment to an implant component, such as the attachment of a selected tibial augment to a tibial implant component, inter operatively, without resorting to cementing and clamping, and without the necessity for assembling loose fasteners with the augment and the implant component. Avoids deleterious effects which otherwise could result from migrating particulate polyethylene, as well as cold flow of polyethylene due to excessive stress at surfaces where the bearing member of a tibial implant is supported by the tibial tray of a tibial implant component. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A securing surface on the securing element is arranged for longitudinal displacement relative to the abutment upon rotation of the securing element. The longitudinal displacement engages the securing surface with the abutment to establish a longitudinal securing force between the securing element and the depending structure for urging the tibial augment against the tibial implant component. This ensures the securement of the tibial augment to the tibial implant component at the augmentation location. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is given for a method of facilitating securement of a selected augment at an augmentation location.

While various approaches aiming towards this goal have been proposed in recent times, a commonly accepted definition and validation procedure is missing. We provide a causal perspective on representation learning which covers disentanglement and domain shift robustness as special cases. Our causal framework allows us to introduce a new metric for the quantitative evaluation of deep latent variable models. We show how this metric can be estimated from labeled observational data and further provide an efficient estimation algorithm that scales linearly in the dataset size.},

abstract = {Recent developments in structural equation modeling have produced several methods that can usually distinguish cause from effect in the two-variable case. For that purpose, however, one has to impose substantial structural constraints or smoothness assumptions on the functional causal models. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the causal direction from a related but different point of view, and propose a new framework for causal direction determination. We show that it is possible to perform causal inference based on the condition that the cause is "exogenous" for the parameters involved in the generating process from the cause to the effect. In this way, we avoid the structural constraints required by the SEM-based approaches. In particular, we exploit nonparametric methods to estimate marginal and conditional distributions, and propose a bootstrap-based approach to test for the exogeneity condition; the testing results indicate the causal direction between two variables. The proposed method is validated on both synthetic and real data.},
