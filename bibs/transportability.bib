@article{Correa2019,
abstract = {Learning systems often face a critical challenge when applied to settings that differ from those under which they were initially trained. In particular, the assumption that both the source/training and the target/deployment domains follow the same causal mechanisms and observed distributions is commonly violated. This implies that the robustness and convergence guarantees usually expected from these methods are no longer attainable. In this paper, we study these violations through causal lens using the formalism of statistical transportability [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] (PB, for short). We start by proving sufficient and necessary graphical conditions under which a probability distribution observed in the source domain can be extrapolated to the target one, where strictly less data is available. We develop the first sound and complete procedure for statistical transportability, which formally closes the problem introduced by PB. Further, we tackle the general challenge of identification of stochastic interventions from observational data [Sec. 4.4, Pearl, 2000]. This problem has been solved in the context of atomic interventions using Pearl's do-calculus, which lacks complete treatment in the stochastic case. We prove completeness of stochastic identification by constructing a reduction of any instance of this problem to an instance of statistical transportability, closing the problem.},

abstract = {When treatment effect modifiers influence the decision to participate in a randomized trial, the average treatment effect in the population represented by the randomized individuals will differ from the effect in other populations. In this tutorial, we consider methods for extending causal inferences about time-fixed treatments from a trial to a new target population of nonparticipants, using data from a completed randomized trial and baseline covariate data from a sample from the target population. We examine methods based on modeling the expectation of the outcome, the probability of participation, or both (doubly robust). We compare the methods in a simulation study and show how they can be implemented in software. We apply the methods to a randomized trial nested within a cohort of trial-eligible patients to compare coronary artery surgery plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone for patients with chronic coronary artery disease. We conclude by discussing issues that arise when using the methods in applied analyses.},

abstract = {When engagement with a randomized trial is driven by factors that affect the outcome or when trial engagement directly affects the outcome independent of treatment, the average treatment effect among trial participants is unlikely to generalize to a target population. In this paper, we use counterfactual and graphical causal models to examine under what conditions we can generalize causal inferences from a randomized trial to the target population of trial-eligible individuals. We offer an interpretation of generalizability analyses using the notion of a hypothetical intervention to "scale-up" trial engagement to the target population. We consider the interpretation of generalizability analyses when trial engagement does or does not directly affect the outcome, highlight connections with censoring in longitudinal studies, and discuss identification of the distribution of counterfactual outcomes via g-formula computation and inverse probability weighting. Last, we show how the methods can be extended to address time-varying treatments, non-adherence, and censoring.},

@article{Cole2010,
abstract = {Properly planned and conducted randomized clinical trials remain susceptible to a lack of external validity. The authors illustrate a model-based method to standardize observed trial results to a specified target population using a seminal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment trial, and they provide Monte Carlo simulation evidence supporting the method. The example trial enrolled 1,156 HIV-infected adult men and women in the United States in 1996, randomly assigned 577 to a highly active antiretroviral therapy and 579 to a largely ineffective combination therapy, and followed participants for 52 weeks. The target population was US people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12%, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence limit coverage, but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage. The proposed method standardizes observed trial results to a specified target population and thereby provides information regarding the generalizability of trial results. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.},

abstract = {We consider integrating a non-probability sample with a probability sample which provides high dimensional representative covariate information of the target population. We propose a two-step approach for variable selection and finite population inference. In the first step, we use penalized estimating equations with folded concave penalties to select important variables and show selection consistency for general samples. In the second step, we focus on a doubly robust estimator of the finite population mean and re-estimate the nuisance model parameters by minimizing the asymptotic squared bias of the doubly robust estimator. This estimating strategy mitigates the possible first-step selection error and renders the doubly robust estimator root n consistent if either the sampling probability or the outcome model is correctly specified.},

We introduce a formal representation called “selection diagrams” for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between populations of in- terest and, using this representation, we derive procedures for deciding whether causal effects in the target environment can be inferred from experimental findings in a dif- ferent environment. When the answer is affirmative, the procedures identify the set of experimental and observational studies that need be conducted to license the transport. We further demonstrate how transportability analysis can guide the transfer of knowl- edge among non-experimental studies to minimize re-measurement cost and improve prediction power. We further provide a causally principled definition of “surrogate endpoint” and show that the theory of transportability can assist the identification of valid},

abstract = {The same intervention can produce different effects in different sites. Transport mediation estimators can estimate the extent to which such differences can be explained by differences in compositional factors and the mechanisms by which mediating or intermediate variables are produced; however, they are limited to consider a single, binary mediator. We propose novel nonparametric estimators of transported stochastic (in)direct effects that consider multiple, high-dimensional mediators and intermediate variables. They are multiply robust, efficient, asymptotically normal, and can incorporate data-adaptive estimation of nuisance parameters. They can be applied to understand differences in treatment effects across sites and/or to predict treatment effects in a target site based on outcome data in source sites.},

abstract = {In natural fresh water, floating plants grow naturally and it vegetation management should be considered as a contaminant remediation solution for large freshwater resources. The ability of Eichhornia crassipes under different design parameter of constructed wetland to remove nutrients & heavy metals from polluted water was studied. The experimental system figured as three levels of water depth (15, 25 or 35 cm) with three levels of plant coverage (90, 70, 50%), and 0% (control)). They were operated for 7 days to detect the optimum time for removal rate. Accordingly, the optimum removal percentages of NH4-N, BOD5, TN and TP were 97.4, 75, 82, 83.9 % after 3, 3, 4, 4 days corresponding to 25, 15, 25, 35 cm water depth and 50, 90, 70, 70% plant coverage, respectively. Water evapotranspiration was found less than free evaporation. Metals were found sufficiently removed, also bioaccumulation rate of the metals in plant tissues arranged in: Fe > Pb > Cu > Ni. The chemical composition of plant was significant different in both shoot and root systems. Therefore, Eichhornia crassipes could be in limited coverage by 70% to save water and make a sustainable phytoremediation for polluted lakes.},
